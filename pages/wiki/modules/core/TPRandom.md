# TPRandom
EssentialsX provides a random teleport feature that can be used in a number of different ways

* Single world TPR
* Multi-world TPR
* Region based RTP

## Simple Setup
For a quick and easy setup of random teleports, you can use `/settpr <world> [center/minrange/maxrange] [value]`. 

This command has parameters for the world you wish to let players TPR in, as well as the center point, minimum block, and maximum blocks they can go to.
With this setup, you can get your players out of spawn by having them use `/tpr`.


## Advanced Setup

For advanced users, who need something a little bit extra, you can take advantage of Multi-World, and region based RTP. 

### Multi-World


### Region Based


## Configuration

`config.yml`

`tpr.yml`
